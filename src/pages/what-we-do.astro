      <p>At Azure Ventures, venture capital is about people. We back entrepreneurs with bold ideas. We support believers, disruptors, visionaries, and fighters. We seek founders with relentless drive, sharp insight, and an unwavering sense of purpose.</p>
      <p>We do not just provide capital. We grow companies</p>
      <p>Early-stage capital should be more than money and advice. We commit fully, delivering hands-on support, operational expertise, and access to a global network. Our fund helps founders scale innovations in clean propulsion systems, port & shipping technology and ocean observation, turning ambition into momentum and vision into value.</p>
