      <p>We bring insider knowledge, founder experience, and the collective wisdom of the sector's most trusted thought leaders.</p>
      
      <p>At Azure Ventures, venture capital is ultimately about people — the entrepreneurs behind bold ideas. We back believers, disruptors, visionaries, and fighters. We seek founders with relentless drive, sharp insight, and an unwavering sense of purpose.</p>
      
      <p>We don't just write checks — we build partnerships. Early-stage capital should be more than money and advice. We commit fully, delivering hands-on support, operational expertise, and access to a global network. We help founders turn ambition into momentum, and vision into value.</p>
